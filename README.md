# WeatherProject
• Developed a weather project to display real-time weather information from https://api.openweathermap.org
• By entering a city name in the input field, the user can obtain weather information.
• Employed the GET method to access the user input field
• I have accessed data from an external server to my web server using the HTTPS GET method, and I then rendered information to the user using the POST method.
