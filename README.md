# WeatherProject
A weather project was made to display real-time weather information from https://api.openweathermap.org.
By entering a city name in the input area, a user can access data.
I utilised the HTTPS GET technique to get weather data from an external server to my web server, and then I could present information to the user by using the POST method. I used the GET method to tap into the user input field.
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, NodeJS, expressjs, and restful APIs are among the technologies used.
